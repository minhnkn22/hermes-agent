# Agent Jobs Client Integration

The machine-wide agent-job supervisor is a local execution service. Coding
clients join it through the same read-only MCP server or the equivalent review
CLI, while target providers are launched through Claude, Codex, and Kimi CLIs.

## Install

Preview and apply native client configuration:

```bash
python3 tools/install_agent_job_clients.py
python3 tools/install_agent_job_clients.py --apply --backup-suffix YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ
python3 tools/install_agent_job_clients.py --check
```

The installer performs structured, idempotent merges and preserves unrelated
settings. Before changing an existing file it creates a sibling
`*.bak.agent-jobs-<suffix>` backup. It manages:

- the shared `~/.agents/skills/agent-jobs` link;
- Claude Desktop's `mcpServers.agent-jobs` registration;
- Kimi Code's user-level `~/.kimi-code/mcp.json` registration; and
- a marked agent-jobs guidance section in `~/.kimi-code/AGENTS.md`.

Restart Claude Desktop and start a new Kimi Code session after applying changes.
Existing sessions retain the tools and instructions loaded when they started.
The installer validates every target and backup slot before writing, and restores
all prior targets if an unexpected later write fails. `--check` exits nonzero
when configuration drift is pending.

To roll back manually, quit the affected client, replace its current config with
the corresponding `*.bak.agent-jobs-<suffix>` file, and restart the client.

## Support Matrix

| Client | Caller binding | Shared policy | Target adapter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex Desktop and CLI | MCP | `~/.agents/skills` plus global guidance | Codex CLI |
| Claude Code, including Desktop code sessions | Review CLI | Claude skill link and `CLAUDE.md` | Claude CLI |
| Claude Desktop chat | Local MCP | Tool schema; coding policy applies in Claude Code sessions | Claude CLI |
| Kimi Code | MCP | `~/.agents/skills` and Kimi `AGENTS.md` | Kimi CLI |
| Hermes profiles | MCP | Per-profile skill copies | Not a provider |

MCP intentionally exposes submit, read, list, cancel, and owner-inbox operations
for read-only jobs.
Explicit implementation remains behind the local capability-protected delegation
CLI. This prevents a general chat client from selecting write mode directly.
Review prompts may contain up to 4 MiB of UTF-8 data. The supervisor's Unix
socket reader is sized for that complete JSON request, so prompts larger than the
former 400 KB ceiling are accepted end to end rather than only by one layer.

`job_read(wait_seconds=N)` waits inside the supervisor and wakes on output,
liveness, or terminal state; it does not spin up repeated client connections.
Terminal jobs with an owner produce an at-least-once `job_inbox` delivery that
survives caller and app restarts and remains until exact-owner acknowledgement.
The caller must inspect the retained result before acknowledgement. MCP cannot
proactively inject a result into a suspended model turn, so clients check their
owner inbox on resume or use a host/app notification layer as an external wakeup.

Native Codex and Claude jobs expose provider-neutral semantic events through
`event_cursor`. Native Claude uses its structured stream, so clients can show
reasoning, provider waits, concurrent tool activity, incremental answer text,
usage, and terminal warnings without parsing the raw log. A failed, cancelled,
or interrupted Claude run retains all top-level assistant-visible text emitted
before termination in `partial_response`. Treat that field as an ordered work
artifact, not necessarily a polished final answer. Native Claude raw stream JSON
is deliberately not returned as `output`/`stdout`; preserve and advance the
event cursor. Kimi and CAO compatibility
jobs retain output-byte observation until their transports expose equivalent
structured events.

## CAO Compatibility Backend

The supervisor preserves its existing lifecycle contract while delegating
provider execution to CAO. This is an opt-in migration path; native execution
remains the default:

```bash
export AGENT_JOB_EXECUTION_BACKEND=cao
export AGENT_JOB_CAO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9889
```

`cao_job_bridge.py` maps provider jobs to CAO sessions, forwards the requested
model and workspace, verifies CAO's actual working directory and persisted
read-only tool policy, emits status transitions, retries bounded transport
interruptions, returns the retained final result, and attempts synchronous CAO
session cleanup on every exit. Signal handlers interrupt blocking HTTP calls so
cleanup starts within the supervisor's termination grace. Provider credentials are not
forwarded to the bridge; CAO launches each native provider with its own local
authentication.

Optional settings are `AGENT_JOB_CAO_TOKEN` and
`AGENT_JOB_CAO_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT`; launch requests are capped at eight seconds so a
cancelled bridge retains time for cleanup before forced termination.
The supervisor's existing hard deadline, soft-stall state, owner binding,
idempotency, durable logs, cursor reads, cancellation, and retention continue to
apply outside CAO. The selected backend is persisted per job, so queued work
does not change transport when configuration changes.

CAO read-only execution is enabled only for Claude and Kimi, whose adapters
enforce native tool denial. Read-only Codex fails before launch because this CAO
fork currently launches Codex without an enforceable sandbox. A positive
`max_turns` also fails closed because CAO has no equivalent limit; the normal
unlimited value remains supported and bounded by the wall-clock deadline.

During the pilot, CAO emits status transitions and a retained final result, not
the provider's incremental token stream. A long quiet processing state can
therefore become `possibly_stalled` even while CAO is alive. The hard deadline
still bounds it. Keep the backend opt-in until the observation window confirms
provider status quality and lease cleanup under real workloads.

Compatibility sessions carry the supervisor hard deadline as a CAO metadata
lease plus `AGENT_JOB_DEPTH`, provider, and job identity in the provider
environment. Same-session child CAO terminals inherit and persist the same
validated lease while the CAO process remains live.
CAO reaps only DB-tracked terminals in expired, dedicated `cao-agent-job-*`
sessions when every tracked terminal carries a matching lease. It deletes those
terminals individually, so an untracked operator-created tmux window is never
removed by the compatibility reaper. Missing, mixed, malformed, or live leases
fail closed.

Compatibility identity survives a CAO server restart through the terminal
metadata database. A new window joining the same session and direct Kimi ACP
startup recover the lease only when every tracked terminal has one matching,
live identity. Mixed, incomplete, expired, or malformed persisted state fails
closed. A fresh unrelated operator session deliberately does not inherit the
lease; normal compatibility children stay in the owned CAO session.

Roll out CAO by provider and exact owner namespace instead of switching every
job at once:

```bash
export AGENT_JOB_EXECUTION_BACKEND=native
export AGENT_JOB_CAO_CANARY_PROVIDERS=claude
export AGENT_JOB_CAO_CANARY_OWNER_PREFIXES=cao-canary:FULL_CAO_COMMIT:
```

`AGENT_JOB_CAO_PROVIDERS` promotes named providers independently of the owner.
`agent_job_migration_gate.py` requires fresh deterministic and live-provider CAO
acceptance reports from the same source commit and model, then at least five
completed canary jobs whose first-to-last completion span is 24 hours, no
interruptions, and a failure rate no greater than ten percent. The evaluator
derives the exact `cao-canary:FULL_CAO_COMMIT:` owner namespace itself and
filters database evidence to the requested model. Threshold arguments can only
tighten those baselines, and the report records every parameter. A passing
gate also verifies the installed LaunchAgent still has native as its default and
contains the exact provider, owner namespace, and CAO URL used for the canary.
Acceptance artifact paths, hashes, source commits, models, and timestamps are
recorded in the verdict. A passing report authorizes a provider-scoped
promotion; it never mutates service configuration itself. Native execution
remains the default until that evidence exists.

To roll back, stop submitting work, let running CAO jobs drain, remove
`AGENT_JOB_EXECUTION_BACKEND=cao`, and restart the supervisor. New jobs return
to native execution; already queued jobs retain their recorded backend.

## Multi-Machine Boundary

The current Unix socket, SQLite database, processes, credentials, workdirs, and
logs are local to one Mac. Run one supervisor per execution host. GitHub remains
the source of truth between hosts. A future cross-machine control plane should
route a job to a host that owns the relevant checkout rather than expose this
user-only Unix socket over the network.
