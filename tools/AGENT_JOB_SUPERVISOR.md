# Agent Job Supervisor

The agent job supervisor owns long-running Claude Code, Codex, and Kimi Code CLI
processes independently of the Codex, Claude, or Hermes session that submitted
them. It replaces caller-bound subprocess waits with durable job IDs.

## Architecture

The supported interface follows a fat-skill, thin-harness split:

- `skills/agent-jobs/` owns provider routing, review rubrics, fallback policy,
  polling judgment, and explicit implementation delegation.
- `tools/review_core.py` owns non-negotiable read-only enforcement, workspace and
  context containment, secret refusal/redaction, bounded Git context, and the
  mapping to supervisor jobs.
- `tools/agent_jobs_server.py` and `tools/review_cli.py` are equivalent bindings
  over that core. The MCP server exposes guarded submit, read, list, cancel, and
  owner-inbox operations; it accepts typed instructions rather than a raw prompt
  and cannot select write mode.
- `tools/agent_job_supervisor.py` owns process lifecycle, persistence,
  credentials, deadlines, concurrency, and capability-gated implementation.

The former `review-sidecars` MCP is retained in source for rollback only. It is
not the active registration after profile migration.

## Lifecycle

1. A caller submits `provider`, `model`, `mode`, `workdir`, `prompt`, an
   idempotency key, and a submit-relative hard deadline over the user-only Unix
   socket.
2. The daemon validates the workdir, model, prompt size, recursion depth, and
   provider, then persists a queued job in SQLite before returning its ID.
3. A machine-wide provider queue atomically claims the job as `launching`, then
   launches it once in a new process group.
4. Output is appended to a cursor log and to separate raw stdout/stderr files.
   Native Codex and Claude JSONL is also normalized into a bounded event journal
   before the human-readable log prefix is added.
5. `read` reports lifecycle state, semantic activity, new output, normalized
   events, silence duration, and terminal output. A bounded wait is held
   server-side and wakes without repeated client sockets.
6. Cancellation sends `SIGTERM` to the process group, waits ten seconds, then
   sends `SIGKILL` if necessary.
7. On daemon restart, previously running jobs are marked `interrupted`. A process
   group is terminated only when PID, PGID, process start time, and resolved
   executable all exactly match the recorded identity.
8. Every terminal transition with a non-empty owner creates one durable inbox
   delivery. Reads redeliver until that exact owner acknowledges it.

Silence does not automatically kill a job. `lifecycle_status` is the persisted
authority; `activity` reports `starting`, `streaming`, `reasoning`,
`tool_running:<name>`, `waiting_on_provider`, `idle_unknown`, or `terminal`.
`open_tool_count` reports concurrent top-level tools while `open_tool` remains
the oldest tool name. Provider-declared waiting is bounded by the same soft
silence threshold and becomes `idle_unknown` if no further progress arrives.
For compatibility, `status` can still report `possibly_stalled` while the
persisted lifecycle remains `running`. Only cancellation or the submit-relative
hard deadline terminates work. Time spent queued counts against that deadline.

## Installation

```bash
/Users/nmmacmini/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python \
  tools/install_agent_job_supervisor.py install
python3 tools/agent_job_client.py ping
```

The LaunchAgent label is `com.atum.agent-job-supervisor`. Runtime state is kept
under `~/.local/state/agent-job-supervisor` with user-only permissions.

## Operations

```bash
python3 tools/agent_job_client.py list
python3 tools/agent_job_client.py read JOB_ID --cursor 0 --event-cursor 0
python3 tools/agent_job_client.py cancel JOB_ID
python3 tools/install_agent_job_supervisor.py status
```

Provider concurrency defaults to Claude 2, Codex 2, and Kimi 1. Override with
`AGENT_JOB_<PROVIDER>_CONCURRENCY` in the LaunchAgent environment. Approved
workspace roots are defined once in `tools/agent_job_policy.py` and used by the
installer, supervisor, review core, and profile migrator. Override them
consistently with `AGENT_JOB_ALLOWED_ROOTS` when deploying elsewhere.

CAO migration is provider-scoped. Keep `AGENT_JOB_EXECUTION_BACKEND=native`,
then set both `AGENT_JOB_CAO_CANARY_PROVIDERS` and
`AGENT_JOB_CAO_CANARY_OWNER_PREFIXES` to route only matching provider/owner
pairs. After the evidence gate passes, move a provider to
`AGENT_JOB_CAO_PROVIDERS`. These settings and CAO connection settings are
forwarded by the LaunchAgent installer; reinstall and restart the service after
changing them. Backend selection is persisted at submission, so rollback does
not rewrite queued or running jobs.

Durable `implement` mode requires both the installed service policy and a random
capability stored in `~/.local/state/agent-job-supervisor/implement.token` with
mode `0600`. The installer enables this policy for the scoped delegation client;
the token prevents accidental or malformed write submissions but is not a
privilege boundary against other processes running as the same macOS user.
The daemon scopes provider API credentials at process launch from its environment
or `AGENT_JOB_PROFILE_ENV`; it never stores credential values in SQLite.

Native Codex, Claude, and Kimi jobs produce schema-v1 records in
`<job>.log.events.jsonl` and assemble assistant message events into
`<job>.log.partial.txt`. Claude runs with `stream-json`, partial messages,
verbose events, and session persistence disabled. Its partial response is all
top-level assistant-visible text in order. Assistant snapshots are reconciled
against streamed prefixes without inferring provider block indices. A successful,
top-level terminal `result.result` is recovered only when no answer text was
otherwise emitted, and records a `terminal_result_recovered` progress marker;
error, nested, non-string, and duplicate terminal results never inject text.
Subagent events are not appended. Tool arguments, tool-result content, thinking
signatures, machine inventories, and account utilization stay out of the
normalized journal. Decoder state is process-local and is never replayed into an
existing partial-response file after restart. If terminal answer size indicates
possible mixed response loss, the result is marked partial and delegation clients
print a warning without exposing the omitted terminal text. Claude stream-prefix
tracking is bounded to 256 blocks and 1 MiB per block; exceeding either bound
suppresses snapshot recovery for that message to avoid duplicate answer text.
Kimi runs with
`stream-json`; its assistant records are incremental message chunks, while tool
calls and results are reduced to names, IDs, and byte counts. Malformed Claude
and Kimi records retain only byte count and digest.
Raw bounded logs remain private operational evidence under the user-only state
directory and are not returned through normal semantic job reads.

Reads advance the normalized stream with the opaque byte `event_cursor`. On
terminal failure, cancellation, or interruption, `partial_response` and
`partial_result_state` make retained work recoverable. Existing callers that
omit `event_cursor` keep their prior log-only behavior for non-semantic
providers; native Claude and Kimi callers consume events and `partial_response`
rather than raw stream JSON. Kimi deliberately keeps output-byte liveness even
with its structured adapter because its JSON stream has no tool-start boundary;
stderr tool progress therefore prevents false stalls during long tools. Partial states are
`complete`, `partial`, `truncated`, `none`, or `unavailable`; the last value
means the selected provider/backend does not have a semantic response adapter.

## Failure Semantics

- `queued`: persisted and waiting for a provider slot.
- `launching`: atomically claimed by the scheduler; provider identity is being
  recorded before the job becomes `running`.
- `running`: persisted lifecycle state for an active daemon-owned process.
- `possibly_stalled`: compatibility status alias when semantic progress is quiet
  past the threshold and no tool is open. This is diagnostic, not terminal;
  inspect `lifecycle_status`, `activity`, and `seconds_without_progress`.
- `completed`: provider exited zero.
- `failed`: launch error, provider non-zero exit, or hard deadline.
- `cancelled`: caller requested cancellation.
- `interrupted`: the supervisor stopped or restarted during execution.

The SQLite database contains prompts only while jobs are queued; prompts are
cleared after provider launch and on every terminal path. Paths and hashes remain
for operations and idempotency. Its directory and files are mode `0700`/`0600`.
Never submit secrets, `.env` contents, credentials, or unrelated private data.
Implementation agents cannot run Bash, tests, or Git; the calling agent remains
responsible for inspecting the diff and running verification.
Combined and raw per-job logs share a total 10 MiB budget. Normalized event
journals default to 2 MiB and partial responses to 256 KiB. Override these with
`AGENT_JOB_MAX_LOG_BYTES`, `AGENT_JOB_MAX_EVENT_BYTES`, and
`AGENT_JOB_MAX_PARTIAL_RESPONSE_BYTES`. Terminal jobs and all associated files
are retained for 14 days by default; `AGENT_JOB_RETENTION_SECONDS` changes that
window. A state-directory lock prevents a second daemon from competing for the
same queue.

Every normalized payload has an aggregate record bound. The reader also skips
and reports an oversized or corrupt record while advancing its cursor, so damaged
journal data cannot wedge later reads. `journal_truncated` remains set after the
journal reaches its byte budget. A normalization/storage failure disables
semantic decoding for that job but raw stdout drainage and capture continue.
Native Claude and Kimi stdout is retained only in the mode-`0600` raw file for
local diagnostics; ordinary reads do not expose it or mirror it into the
combined log. Set `AGENT_JOB_KIMI_SEMANTIC=0` in the LaunchAgent environment and
restart to restore Kimi's prior text argv, public stdout, and adapter-unavailable
contract for newly submitted jobs as an emergency rollback. Each job persists
its `semantic_stream` selection at submission, so toggling the kill switch never
reinterprets retained or already queued jobs and cannot expose their structured
stdout.
